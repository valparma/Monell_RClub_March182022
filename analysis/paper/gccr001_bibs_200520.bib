abstract = {"Sniffin' Sticks" is a test of nasal chemosensory function that is based on pen-like odor dispensing devices, introduced some 10 years ago by Kobal and co-workers. It consists of tests for odor threshold, discrimination, and identification. Previous work established its test-retest reliability and validity. Results of the test are presented as "TDI score", the sum of results obtained for threshold, discrimination, and identification measures. While normative data have been established they are based on a relatively small number of subjects, especially with regard to subjects older than 55 years where data from only 30 healthy subjects have been used. The present study aimed to remedy this situation. Now data are available from 3,282 subjects as compared to data from 738 subjects published previously. Disregarding sex-related differences, the TDI score at the tenth percentile was 24.9 in subjects younger than 15 years, 30.3 for ages from 16 to 35 years, 27.3 for ages from 36 to 55 years, and 19.6 for subjects older than 55 years. Because the tenth percentile has been defined to separate hyposmia from normosmia, these data can be used as a guide to estimate individual olfactory ability in relation to subject's age. Absolute hyposmia was defined as the tenth percentile score of 16-35 year old subjects. Other than previous reports the present norms are also sex-differentiated with women outperforming men in the three olfactory tests. Further, the present data suggest specific changes of individual olfactory functions in relation to age, with odor thresholds declining most dramatically compared to odor discrimination and odor identification. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Almost every odor we encounter in daily life has the capacity to produce a trigeminal sensation. Surprisingly, few functional imaging studies exploring human neuronal correlates of intranasal trigeminal function exist, and results are to some degree inconsistent. We utilized activation likelihood estimation (ALE), a quantitative voxel-based meta-analysis tool, to analyze functional imaging data (fMRI/PET) following intranasal trigeminal stimulation with carbon dioxide (CO2), a stimulus known to exclusively activate the trigeminal system. Meta-analysis tools are able to identify activations common across studies, thereby enabling activation mapping with higher certainty. Activation foci of nine studies utilizing trigeminal stimulation were included in the meta-analysis. We found significant ALE scores, thus indicating consistent activation across studies, in the brainstem, ventrolateral posterior thalamic nucleus, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, precentral gyrus, as well as in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices-a network known for the processing of intranasal nociceptive stimuli. Significant ALE values were also observed in the piriform cortex, insula, and the orbitofrontal cortex, areas known to process chemosensory stimuli, and in association cortices. Additionally, the trigeminal ALE statistics were directly compared with ALE statistics originating from olfactory stimulation, demonstrating considerable overlap in activation. In conclusion, the results of this meta-analysis map the human neuronal correlates of intranasal trigeminal stimulation with high statistical certainty and demonstrate that the cortical areas recruited during the processing of intranasal CO2 stimuli include those outside traditional trigeminal areas. Moreover, through illustrations of the considerable overlap between brain areas that process trigeminal and olfactory information; these results demonstrate the interconnectivity of flavor processing. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The objective of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis that subjects with parosmia suffer more in their daily life than patients who experience only quantitative olfactory loss. Two hundred five outpatients of the Smell and Taste Clinic and 25 healthy controls were included. The newly developed Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders (QOD) was administered in combination with other psychometric tests (Beck Depression Inventory, "Befindlichkeitsskala" and the Short Form-36 Health Survey) along with an olfactory test ("Sniffin' Sticks"). Results of the QOD were found to be an appropriate and valid measure of the impact of olfactory dysfunction on daily life. Patients with parosmia and quantitative olfactory dysfunction show higher rates of daily life complaints when compared to patients suffering from quantitative olfactory impairment only (QOD-PS: P=0.005). In addition, hyposmic and anosmic patients indicated significantly more complaints compared to patients with normosmia. Further, female patients seemed to suffer more from olfactory dysfunction than male patients. In conclusion, the assessment of the degree of qualitative olfactory dysfunction may be possible by the use of instruments based on questionnaires regarding daily life problems. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

This article describes a study of 750 patients with complaints of abnormal smell or taste perception from the University of Pennsylvania Smell and Taste Center, Philadelphia. Major findings suggest that: chemosensory dysfunction influences quality of life; complaints of taste loss usually reflect loss of smell function; upper respiratory infection, head trauma, and chronic nasal and paranasal sinus disease are the most common causes of the diminution of the sense of smell, with head trauma having the greatest loss; depression frequently accompanies chemosensory distortion; low body weight accompanies burning mouth syndrome; estrogens protect against loss of the sense of smell in postmenopausal women; zinc therapy may provide no benefit to patients with chemosensory dysfunction; and thyroid hormone function is associated with oral sensory distortion. The findings are discussed in relation to management of patients with chemosensory disturbances.

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of self-reported ratings of olfactory function in 83 healthy subjects. Such ratings were compared with quantitative measures of olfactory function, as well as with ratings of nasal patency. In experiment 1 subjects rated olfactory function and nasal patency before olfactory testing, whereas in experiment 2 the reverse was the case. No feedback regarding test results were provided until after completion of the testing. The principal findings were: (i) when ratings preceded measurements of olfactory function, there was no significant correlation between the two parameters. However, ratings of olfactory function correlated significantly with ratings of nasal airway patency. (ii) In contrast, when measurements of olfactory function preceded the ratings, this constellation switched. Now ratings of olfactory function correlated significantly with measured olfactory function, whereas there was no significant correlation between ratings of nasal airway patency and ratings of olfactory function. In conclusion, these data suggest that ratings of olfactory function are unreliable in healthy, untrained subjects. The ratings seem to reflect changes of nasal airway patency to a larger degree than measurable olfactory function. The results further indicate that this is mainly due to the limited attention the sense of smell receives in daily life. {\textcopyright} Oxford University Press 2003; all rights reserved.},

abstract = {Context: Older adults represent the fastest-growing segment of the US population, and prevalences of vision and hearing impairment have been extensively evaluated. However, despite the importance of sense of smell for nutrition and safety, the prevalence of olfactory impairment in older US adults has not been studied. Objective: To determine the prevalence of olfactory impairment in older adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: A total of 2491 Beaver Dam, Wis, residents aged 53 to 97 years participating in the 5-year follow-up examination (1998-2000) for the Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study, a population-based, cross-sectional study. Main Outcome Measures Olfactory impairment, assessed by the San Diego Odor Identification Test and self-report. Results: The mean (SD) prevalence of impaired olfaction was 24.5{\%} (1.7{\%}). The prevalence increased with age; 62.5{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [Cl], 57.4{\%}-67.7{\%}) of 80to 97-year-olds had olfactory impairment. Olfactory impairment was more prevalent among men (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.92; 95{\%} Cl, 1.65-2.19). Current smoking, stroke, epilepsy, and nasal congestion or upper respiratory tract infection were also associated with increased prevalence of olfactory impairment. Self-reported olfactory impairment was low (9.5{\%}) and this measure became less accurate with age. In the oldest group, aged 80 to 97 years, sensitivity of self-report was 12{\%} for women and 18{\%} for men. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that prevalence of olfactory impairment among older adults is high and increases with age. Self-report significantly underestimated prevalence rates obtained by olfaction testing. Physicians and caregivers should be particularly alert to the potential for olfactory impairment in the elderly population.},

abstract = {Objective - To enable adequate planning of ENT Healthcare it is important to know the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in the general population. Whether an individual will actually seek medical attention for olfactory dysfunction is likely to depend predominantly on his/her self-evaluation of the sense of smell. This motivated an investigation of the prevalences of self-reported poorer- and better-than-normal odor detection sensitivity in the general population. Material and Methods - A random sample of 1900 adult inhabitants, stratified for age and gender, was drawn from the municipal population register of Sk{\"{o}}vde, Sweden. Subjects were asked to attend a structured interview concerning their self-evaluation of their odor detection sensitivity. Results - In total, 1387 volunteers (73{\%} of the sample) were investigated. The overall prevalences of self-reported poorer-and better-than normal odor detection sensitivity were 15.3{\%} and 17.4{\%}, respectively. The prevalence of poorer sensitivity was found to increase with age, and the prevalence of better sensitivity was lower in men than women. Conclusions - Considering the fairly high participation rate in this study and the fact that the population of Sk{\"{o}}vde is representative of the general Swedish population, the obtained prevalences can be considered representative of the general Swedish adult population.},

Study design :Cross-sectional survey in Dortmund, Germany. Methods :The population sample was randomly drawn from the city's central registration office. Following a standardized interview, validated taste and smell tests were performed. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression was used in the analysis. Results :Among the 1312 study participants, 3.6 {\%} were functionally anosmic, and 18 {\%} had olfactory dysfunction.

Heavy smokers of 20 or more cigarettes/day had significant increased risks for impairment in both senses. Conclusions :Our results reveal that both olfactory and gustatory function are compromised in a significant proportion of the general population. Smoking increases significantly the risk of impairment of olfactory function.

abstract = {Information about the prevalence of disorders of the chemical senses has been limited. In the late 1970s, the consensus among experts convened by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was that more than 2 million adults in the United States had a disorder of smell or taste. A large, nonrandom survey conducted by the National Geographic Society in 1987 found that 1{\%} of their 1.2 million respondents could not smell 3 or more of 6 odorants using a 'scratch and sniff' test. Age was an important factor, with a decline beginning in the second decade of life. No comparable data have been available for taste, although it has been suggested that the sense of taste remains more robust with age. The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), NIH, began collaborating with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) in 1993 to acquire information on the prevalence of smell/taste problems using the Disability Supplement to the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). This survey was administered to approximately 42,000 randomly-selected households (representing about 80,000 adults over 18 years of age) in 1994. Adjusted national estimates derived from this survey showed a prevalence of 2.7 million (1.4{\%}) U.S. adults with an olfactory problem. Also, 1.1 million (0.6{\%}) adults reported a gustatory problem. When smell or taste problems were combined, 3.2 million (1.65{\%}) adults indicated a chronic chemosensory problem. The prevalence rates increased exponentially with age. Almost 40{\%} with a chemosensory problem (1.5 million) were 65 years of age or greater. In a multivariate analysis, the individual's overall health status, other sensory impairments, functional limitations (including difficulty standing or bending), depression, phobia, and several other health-related characteristics were associated with an increase in the rate of chemosensory disorders.},

In addition, they were given the chance to answer 43 specific questions about the consequences of their olfactory dysfunction. Results: Although there are less practical problems associated with impaired or distorted odor perception than with impairments in visual or auditory perception, many affected individuals report experiencing olfactory dysfunction as a debilitating condition. Smell loss-induced social isolation and smell loss-induced anhedonia can severely affect quality of life. Conclusions: Olfactory dysfunction is a serious condition for those affected by it and it deserves more attention from doctors who treat affected patients as well as from scientist who research treatment options. {\textcopyright} 2013 Keller and Malaspina; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {The present investigation aimed to compare trigeminal nasal function of anosmic and hyposmic patients to healthy controls. Further, we aimed to study effects of age and gender on trigeminally mediated sensations following intranasal chemosensory stimulation. Participants were 35 patients with olfactory dysfunction (n=13: functional anosmia; n=22: hyposmia; age 28-69 years, mean age 56 years). Their results were compared with 17 normosmic subjects (28-82 years, mean 52 years). To analyze effects of age and gender in healthy subjects, an additional 24 healthy subjects were included (19-27 years; mean 24 years). Olfactory function was assessed using the 'Sniffin‚Ä≤ Sticks' test kit (butanol odor threshold, odor discrimination, odor identification). The subjects' ability to lateralize odors was investigated for benzaldehyde and eucalyptol. Patients with olfactory dysfunction had lower scores in the lateralization task than controls (P{\textless}0.001) indicating decreased trigeminal sensitivity. Among anosmic patients scores were not different in relation to different causes of olfactory dysfunction (P{\textgreater}0.29). There was a weak, but significant, correlation between localization of eucalyptol and duration of olfactory dysfunction (P=0.017). When investigating normosmic subjects only, no gender-related difference was apparent for lateralization scores. However, older subjects had lower scores than younger ones (P{\textless}0.01). Results of partial correlational analyses controlling for age suggested a relation between the trigeminal and the olfactory systems. In conclusion, results of the present study indicate that patients with olfactory dysfunction have lower trigeminal sensitivity compared with normosmic controls. This seems to be independent of the cause of olfactory loss. The deficit appears to improve with duration of the olfactory dysfunction, possibly indicating adaptive mechanisms. Further, the data suggest an age-related decrease of intranasal trigeminal sensitivity in healthy subjects. Analyses additionally indicate a correlation between olfactory and trigeminal sensitivity. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Doty2004a,
abstract = {The fact that so many varied medications reportedly affect taste and smell is a testament to the complexity of the gustatory and olfactory systems. The reception, transduction, propagation, and perception of a chemical tastant or odorant requires the effective operation of numerous mechanisms - all of which may be susceptible in one way or another to a prescribed medication. Just as a diuretic may block the apical ion channels on a taste bud, or an antifungal can inhibit cytochrome p450-dependent enzymes at the level of the receptors, a chemotherapeutic agent can destroy mitosis in a replicating receptor cell and a steroid can lead to candidal overgrowth on the tongue surface. Medications not only have a perceivable taste themselves at times, but they can alter the mechanisms responsible for the ultimate perception of tastes and smells - either by direct or secondary means. It should be emphasized, as noted earlier in this article, that while many medications are to blame for the impairment or distortion of the gustatory or olfactory systems, it is not uncommon that the underlying medical problem for which they are prescribed is actually the culprit. Examples include epilepsy, migraines, hypothyroidism, schizpophrenia, infections, and cancer. In fact, simple partial seizures emanating from regions of the brain such as the amygdala, hippocampus, parietal operculum, and rolandic operculum can lead to the chemosensory sensations that are most commonly considered unpleasant, such as "rotten apples," "cigarette," "peculiar," or "vomitus" [72]. While removing or changing an offending medication can reverse the effects on smell or taste perception, it is important to remember that lasting impairment may occur. This is vital for a physician to recognize prior to prescribing a medication. It is also necessary to report this to patients who may be devastated by chemosensory alterations after starting a new medication (eg, pastry chef, perfumist, wine specialist, plumber). Among the "risks" in a risks/benefits discussion with a patient regarding the use of a new medication, alterations in olfaction and taste appear to play an increasingly recognized role.},

abstract = {Assessment of gustatory sensitivity in a clinical setting is the prerequisite for correct diagnosis and adequate treatment of taste dysfunction. Despite of this, no taste test has been established for the routine clinical testing. The aim of the present study was to create a protocol which is easy to administer. The presently used technique is based on strips made from filter paper which were impregnated with different taste solutions (four concentrations each for sweet, sour, salty and bitter). These strips are placed on the tongue and subjects are asked to identify the taste quality. After establishing the concentration range of the taste solutions, the test was tried in 69 subjects. Each subject received eighteen taste strips (four concentrations of each, taste quality plus two blanks) in a pseudo-randomized sequence. Results from this new procedure correlated significantly with the results of the well established extensive three-drop-technique (r69=0.67). Repeated measures indicated good reproducibility of the results for the taste strips (r69=0.68). These data suggest the usefulness of this new technique in routine clinical practice. Major advantages are long shelf-life, convenience of administration, short time needed for testing (approximately 8 rain), and the possibility to test each side of the tongue separately.},

abstract = {Objectives/Hypothesis:Goals of the study were to evaluate the frequency of olfactory dysfunction in a large representative population without sinonasal complaints and to investigate the extent to which general pathological conditions, medications, and aging influence olfaction. Study Design:Prospective. Methods:Results based on an odor identification test (‚ÄúSniffin' Sticks‚Äù) were reported from 1240 subjects. The subjects presented themselves to an otorhinolaryngology outpatient clinic with relatively mild and transitory complaints unrelated to the upper airways. A detailed otorhinolaryngological examination in combination with a standardized interview further ascertained that these patients had no rhinological problems or symptoms relating to sinonasal disease. Results:Apart from the confirmation of the effects of age, gender, and certain otorhinolaryngological diseases on the sense of smell, the study results revealed that certain general diseases (liver diseases, nonotolaryngological cancers) appear to influence olfactory function, whereas other diseases or disorders have little or no impact on olfaction (hypertension, cardiovascular problems). Conclusion:The data in the study revealed that olfactory dysfunction among subjects under 65 years of age is more frequent than previously reported. {\textcopyright} 2004 American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.},

abstract = {Objectives/Hypothesis: Patients with olfactory dysfunction appear repeatedly in ear, nose, and throat practices, but the prevalence of such problems in the general adult population is not known. Therefore, the objectives were to investigate the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in an adult Swedish population and to relate dysfunction to age, gender, diabetes mellitus, nasal polyps, and smoking habits. Study Design: Cross-sectional, population-based epidemiological study. Methods: A random sample of 1900 adult inhabitants, who were stratified for age and gender, was drawn from the municipal population register of Sk{\"{o}}vde, Sweden. Subjects were called to clinical visits that included questions about olfaction, diabetes, and smoking habits. Examination was performed with a smell identification test and nasal endoscopy. Results: In all, 1387 volunteers (73{\%} of the sample) were investigated. The overall prevalence of olfactory dysfunction was 19.1{\%}, composed of 13.3{\%} with hyposmia and 5.8{\%} with anosmia. A logistic regression analysis showed a significant relationship between impaired olfaction and aging, male gender, and nasal polyps, but not diabetes or smoking. In an analysis of a group composed entirely of individuals with anosmia, diabetes mellitus and nasal polyps were found to be risk factors, and gender and smoking were not. Conclusion: The sample size of the population-based study was adequate, with a good fit to the entire population, which suggests that it was representative for the Swedish population. Prevalence data for various types of olfactory dysfunction could be given with reasonable precision, and suggested risk factors analyzed. The lack of a statistically significant relationship between olfactory dysfunction and smoking may be controversial.},

Risk of olfactory dysfunction increases with old age and may also result from chronic sinonasal diseases, severe head trauma, and upper respiratory infections, or neurodegenerative diseases. These disorders impair the ability to sense warning odors in foods and the environment, as well as hinder the quality of life related to social interactions, eating, and feelings of wellbeing. This article reports and extends on a clinical update commencing at the 2016 Association for Chemoreception Sciences annual meeting. Included were reports from: a patient perspective on losing the sense of smell with information on Fifth Sense, a nonprofit advocacy organization for patients with olfactory disorders; an otolaryngologist's review of clinical evaluation, diagnosis, and management/treatment of anosmia; and researchers' review of recent advances in potential anosmia treatments from fundamental science, in animal, cellular, or genetic models. As limited evidence-based treatments exist for anosmia, dissemination of information on anosmia-related health risks is needed. This could include feasible and useful screening measures for olfactory dysfunction, appropriate clinical evaluation, and patient counseling to avoid harm as well as manage health and quality of life with anosmia.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Olfactory dysfunction is an increasingly recognised condition, associated with reduced quality of life and major health outcomes such as neurodegeneration and death. However, translational research in this field is limited by heterogeneity in methodological approach, including definitions of impairment, improvement and appropriate assessment techniques. Accordingly, effective treatments for smell loss are limited. In an effort to encourage high quality and comparable work in this field, among others, we propose the following ideas and recommendations. Whilst the full set of recommendations are outlined in the main document, points include the following: - Patients with suspected olfactory loss should undergo a full examination of the head and neck, including rigid nasal endoscopy with small diameter endoscopes. - Subjective olfactory assessment should not be undertaken in isolation, given its poor reliability. - Psychophysical assessment tools used in clinical and research settings should include reliable and validated tests of odour threshold, and/or one of odour identification or discrimination. - Comprehensive chemosensory assessment should include gustatory screening. - Smell training can be helpful in patients with olfactory loss of several aetiologies. CONCLUSIONS We hope the current manuscript will encourage clinicians and researchers to adopt a common language, and in so doing, increase the methodological quality, consistency and generalisability of work in this field.},

abstract = {Flavor is perhaps the most multi-modal of all of our sensory experiences. Here flavor is defined as a perception that includes gustatory, oral-somatosensory, and retronasal olfactory signals that arise from the mouth as foods and beverages are consumed. Although the sights, sounds and smells of foods that occur just before, or in the absence of eating, can impact flavor perception, it is argued that these sensory signals exert their influence by creating expectations based upon prior associations. The primary aim of the paper is to review anatomical and neurophysiological data towards an understanding of how the core sensory signals combine in the central nervous system of humans. Based upon the extant literature it is proposed that taste, oral-somatosensory and olfactory inputs are first integrated in the anterior ventral insula. The core flavor percept is then conveyed to upstream regions in the brainstem and thalamus, as well as downstream regions in the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex to produce the rich flavorful experiences that guide our feeding behavior. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The olfactory and trigeminal systems are intimately connected as most odorants stimulate both sensory systems. They interact by mutually suppressing and enhancing each other. However, the location and the degree of their interaction remain unclear. One method to test sensitivity in the trigeminal system is the odor localization task: when an odorant is presented to one nostril, we are able to localize the stimulated nostril only if the odorant stimulates the trigeminal nerve. Our objective was to evaluate the interaction between olfactory and trigeminal system by measuring the effect of an olfactory co-stimulation on the ability to localize a trigeminal stimulus. More specifically, we evaluated the influence of an olfactory co-stimulation with pure odors (phenyl ethanol, vanillin), presented either ipsilaterally or contralaterally, on the localization of predominantly trigeminal stimuli (mustard oil, eucalyptol). The ipsilateral, but not the contralateral, olfactory co-stimulation with a pure odorant increased the capacity to localize a trigeminal stimulus. These results suggest an interaction between the olfactory and trigeminal systems at peripheral, that is, mucosal, levels.},

We identify approximately 93{\%} of an estimated 1500 mouse ORs, exceeding previous estimates and the number of human ORs by 50{\%}. Only 20{\%} are pseudogenes, giving a functional OR repertoire in mice that is three times larger than that of human. The proteins encoded by intact human ORs are less highly conserved than those of mouse, in patterns that suggest that even some apparently intact human OR genes may encode non-functional proteins. Mouse ORs are clustered in 46 genomic locations, compared to a much more dispersed pattern in human. We find orthologous clusters at syntenic human locations for most mouse genes, indicating that most OR gene clusters predate primate-rodent divergence. However, many recent local OR duplications in both genomes obscure one-to-one orthologous relationships, thereby complicating cross-species inferences about OR-ligand interactions. Local duplications are the major force shaping the gene family. Recent interchromosomal duplications of ORs have also occurred, but much more frequently in human than in mouse. In addition to clarifying the evolutionary forces shaping this gene family, our study provides the basis for functional studies of the transcriptional regulation and ligand-binding capabilities of the OR gene family.},

In chronic airway diseases, defective repair leads to tissue remodeling. Delineating key drivers of differentiation dynamics can help understand how normal or pathological regeneration occurs. Using single-cell transcriptomics and lineage inference, we have unraveled trajectories from basal to luminal cells, providing novel markers for specific populations. We report that: (1) a precursor subgroup of multiciliated cells, which we have entitled deuterosomal cells, is defined by specific markers, such as DEUP1, FOXN4, YPEL1, HES6 and CDC20B; (2) goblet cells can be precursors of multiciliated cells, thus explaining the presence of hybrid cells that co-express markers of goblet and multiciliated cells; and (3) a repertoire of molecules involved in the regeneration process, such as keratins or components of the Notch, Wnt or BMP/TGF$\beta$ pathways, can be identified. Confirmation of our results on fresh human and pig airway samples, and on mouse tracheal cells, extend and confirm our conclusions regarding the molecular and cellular choreography at work during mucociliary epithelial differentiation.},

abstract = {Background: Olfaction is a versatile sensory mechanism for detecting thousands of volatile odorants. Although molecular basis of odorant signaling is relatively well understood considerable gaps remain in the complete charting of all relevant gene products. To address this challenge, we applied RNAseq to four well-characterized human olfactory epithelial samples and compared the results to novel and published mouse olfactory epithelium as well as 16 human control tissues. Results: We identified 194 non-olfactory receptor (OR) genes that are overexpressed in human olfactory tissues vs. controls. The highest overexpression is seen for lipocalins and bactericidal/permeability-increasing (BPI)-fold proteins, which in other species include secreted odorant carriers. Mouse-human discordance in orthologous lipocalin expression suggests different mammalian evolutionary paths in this family. Of the overexpressed genes 36 have documented olfactory function while for 158 there is little or no previous such functional evidence. The latter group includes GPCRs, neuropeptides, solute carriers, transcription factors and biotransformation enzymes. Many of them may be indirectly implicated in sensory function, and {\~{}}70 {\%} are over expressed also in mouse olfactory epithelium, corroborating their olfactory role. Nearly 90 {\%} of the intact OR repertoire, and {\~{}}60 {\%} of the OR pseudogenes are expressed in the olfactory epithelium, with the latter showing a 3-fold lower expression. ORs transcription levels show a 1000-fold inter-paralog variation, as well as significant inter-individual differences. We assembled 160 transcripts representing 100 intact OR genes. These include 1-4 short 5' non-coding exons with considerable alternative splicing and long last exons that contain the coding region and 3' untranslated region of highly variable length. Notably, we identified 10 ORs with an intact open reading frame but with seemingly non-functional transcripts, suggesting a yet unreported OR pseudogenization mechanism. Analysis of the OR upstream regions indicated an enrichment of the homeobox family transcription factor binding sites and a consensus localization of a specific transcription factor binding site subfamily (Olf/EBF). Conclusions: We provide an overview of expression levels of ORs and auxiliary genes in human olfactory epithelium. This forms a transcriptomic view of the entire OR repertoire, and reveals a large number of over-expressed uncharacterized human non-receptor genes, providing a platform for future discovery.},

abstract = {The mammalian olfactory epithelium (OE) sustains persistent neurogenesis even in the adult. Sustentacular cells therein play both epithelial and neuroglial roles, although their relation with olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and their function in ORN maturation remain insufficiently understood. Sustentacular wrapping of ORN dendrites has been long known but always considered a minor presence, as opposed to the supposedly unwrapped majority of ORN dendrites at inter-sustentacular borderlines. Using immunofluorescence, confocal and immuno-electron microscopy, the current study examined cytoarchitectonic organization and maturation of ORN dendrites at the rat OE apical layer. Contrary to common belief, the observations here on tangential histological sections of the OE apical junctional belt layer showed on average 53.93{\%} sustentacular cell-enwrapped, 18.46{\%} partially wrapped (in the vertical grooves on the sides of sustentacular apices) and 27.61{\%} unwrapped ORN dendrites (at the borderlines between sustentacular cells). The enwrapped dendrites were found within the confines of sustentacular apices but linked to the sides of the latter each by a mesentery (mesodendrite) of sustentacular plasma membranes and autotypic cell junctions. Up to six dendrites were seen in one sustentacular apical process. As marked by high and low immunoreactivity for class III beta-tubulin, respectively, immature and mature ORN dendrites accounted on average for 12.46 and 87.54{\%} of the total ORN dendrites at the OE apical layer. By correlative analysis of the maturity level and wrapping status, most immature ORN dendrites were found unwrapped (immature unwrapped¬†=¬†9.71{\%} of the total dendrites), and practically no immature dendrites appeared enwrapped. In contrast, mature ORN dendrites comprised all the enwrapped (mature enwrapped¬†=¬†53.93{\%} of the total), most of the partially wrapped (mature partially wrapped¬†=¬†15.71{\%} of the total) and a portion of the unwrapped ORN dendrites (mature unwrapped¬†=¬†17.9{\%} of the total dendrites). Based on the current findings and previous data by other researchers, it is concluded that immature ORN dendrites emerge vertically from the OE apical surface between sustentacular cell apices. A large majority of the newly emerged dendrites then undergo sideways migration, sustentacular enwrapment and further maturation. Only a small minority of the newly emerged dendrites reach maturity and remain unwrapped. These divergent maturational courses imply structural or functional differences between the enwrapped and unwrapped mature ORN dendrites.},

abstract = {Several factors modulate the first step of odour detection in the rat olfactory mucosa (OM). Among others, vasoactive peptides such as endothelin might play multifaceted roles in the different OM cells. Like their counterparts in the central nervous system, the olfactory sensory neurons are encompassed by different glial-like non-neuronal OM cells; sustentacular cells (SCs) surround their cell bodies, whereas olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) wrap their axons. Whereas SCs maintain both the structural and ionic integrity of the OM, OECs assure protection, local blood flow control and guiding of olfactory sensory neuron axons toward the olfactory bulb. We previously showed that these non-neuronal OM cells are particularly responsive to endothelin in vitro. Here, we confirmed that the endothelin system is strongly expressed in the OM using in situ hybridization. We then further explored the effects of endothelin on SCs and OECs using electrophysiological recordings and calcium imaging approaches on both in vitro and ex vivo OM preparations. Endothelin induced both robust calcium signals and gap junction uncoupling in both types of cells. This latter effect was mimicked by carbenoxolone, a known gap junction uncoupling agent. However, although endothelin is known for its antiapoptotic effect in the OM, the uncoupling of gap junctions by carbenoxolone was not sufficient to limit the cellular death induced by serum deprivation in OM primary culture. The functional consequence of the endothelin 1-induced reduction of the gap junctional communication between OM non-neuronal cells thus remains to be elucidated.},

abstract = {Background: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is among the most common causes of olfactory loss. The loss of the sense of smell is thought to result from structural and functional changes occurring in the olfactory epithelium caused by inflammation. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying CRS-associated olfactory loss remain incompletely understood. Methods: Transgenic mice expressing TNF-alpha specifically within the olfactory epithelium were used as a model for CRS-associated olfactory loss. TNF-alpha expression was induced over different time intervals, and olfactory epithelial tissue was assessed for the expression of neuronal markers by laser scanning confocal microscopy and Western blot. Results: TNF-alpha expression results in an inflammatory infiltrate in the olfactory epithelium, thinning of the olfactory neuron layer, and a progressive loss of olfactory function. Reduced expression of markers for neurons and mature olfactory neurons (neural cell adhesion molecule [NCAM] and olfactory marker protein [OMP], respectively) was observed in the neuroepithelium and in the subepithelial axon bundles. Expression of growth-associated protein (GAP) 43, a marker for immature neurons, was also reduced. These alterations were reversed when TNF-alpha expression was discontinued. Conclusion: TNF-alpha expression in a transgenic model of CRS-associated olfactory loss results in progressive loss of olfactory neurons. Decreased GAP-43 expression suggests that TNF-alpha-associated inflammation inhibits differentiation of progenitor cells into immature olfactory neurons. Therefore, reduced regeneration of olfactory neurons may be an important mechanism underlying olfactory loss in CRS, in addition to neuronal loss or apoptosis. This mouse model represents a potential tool in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the prevention of olfactory neuron loss in CRS.

In contrast, olfactory epithelial support cells and stem cells express both of these genes, as do cells in the nasal respiratory epithelium. Taken together, these findings suggest possible mechanisms through which CoV-2 infection could lead to anosmia or other forms of olfactory dysfunction.},

abstract = {The recent emergence of the pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 initiated a worldwide health crisis. The entry of the virus into cells is mediated by the binding of the viral Spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), followed by its priming by the TMPRSS2 serine protease, both present on the cellular membrane of the target cells. In the respiratory tract, these targets are ciliated cells. Interestingly, various reports indicate an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and anosmia, suggesting an alteration not restricted to the respiratory tissue, but that might also include the olfactory sensory epithelium. We explored this possibility by generating RNA-seq libraries from human neuroepithelium, in which we found significant expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. To determine whether specific cell types of this chemosensory tissue may coexpress both of the virus entry genes, we analyzed a scRNA-seq dataset. We determined that sustentacular cells, which are in direct contact with the external world and maintain the integrity of olfactory sensory neurons, represents a prime candidate for SARS-CoV-2 infection via the nose, and possibly for SARS-CoV-2-induced anosmia.},

abstract = {A novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December of 2019. This new coronavirus has resulted in thousands of cases of lethal disease in China, with additional patients being identified in a rapidly growing number internationally. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public database and the state-of-the-art single-cell RNA-Seq technique, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the normal human lungs. The result indicates that the ACE2 virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells (AT2). Surprisingly, we found that this population of ACE2-expressing AT2 also highly expressed many other genes that positively regulating viral reproduction and transmission. A comparison between eight individual samples demonstrated that the Asian male one has an extremely large number of ACE2-expressing cells in the lung. This study provides a biological background for the epidemic investigation of the 2019-nCov infection disease, and could be informative for future anti-ACE2 therapeutic strategy development.},

abstract = {By engaging angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2 or Ace2), the novel pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may invade host cells in many organs, including the brain. However, the distribution of ACE2 in the brain is still obscure. Here we investigated the ACE2 expression in the brain by analyzing data from publicly available brain transcriptome databases. According to our spatial distribution analysis, ACE2 was relatively highly expressed in some important brain areas, such as the substantia nigra and brain ventricles. According to our cell-type distribution analysis, the expression of ACE2 were found in many neurons (both excitatory and inhibitory neurons) and some non-neuron cells (mainly astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) in human middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex, but the ACE2-expressing cells was none in the prefrontal cortex and very few in the hippocampus. Except for the additional high expression of Ace2 in the olfactory bulb areas for spatial distribution as well as in the pericytes and endothelial cells for cell-type distribution, the distribution of Ace2 in mouse brain was similar to that in the human brain. Thus, our results reveal an outline of ACE2/Ace2 distribution in the human and mouse brain, which indicates the brain infection of SARS-CoV-2 may be capable to result in serious central nervous system symptoms in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.},

abstract = {The mammalian olfactory system detects chemicals sensed as odours as well as social cues that stimulate innate responses. Odorants are detected in the nasal olfactory epithelium by the odorant receptor family, whose ‚àº1,000 members allow the discrimination of a myriad of odorants. Here we report the discovery of a second family of receptors in the mouse olfactory epithelium. Genes encoding these receptors, called 'trace amine-associated receptors' (TAARs), are present in human, mouse and fish. Like odorant receptors, individual mouse TAARs are expressed in unique subsets of neurons dispersed in the epithelium. Notably, at least three mouse TAARs recognize volatile amines found in urine: one detects a compound linked to stress, whereas the other two detect compounds enriched in male versus female urine - one of which is reportedly a pheromone. The evolutionary conservation of the TAAR family suggests a chemosensory function distinct from odorant receptors. Ligands identified for TAARs thus far suggest a function associated with the detection of social cues. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {The present study on the main olfactory system (MOS) and the accessory olfactory system (AOS) documents the functional morphology of the rodent olfactory region and that of the vomeronasal organ (VNO) using light and electron microscopical techniques. Special attention is given to the cytoarchitecture of the sensory epithelia, i. e. the olfactory epithelium (OE) of the regio olfactoria and the neuroepithelium of the VNO (VNO-NE). Both sensory epithelia consist of a pseudostratified columnar epithelium composed of three types of cells, i. e. receptor cells, supporting cells and progenitor cells. Even at the light microscopical level, however, distinctive morphological features can be distinguished which illustrate important differences between the two sensory epithelia. For example, the height of the respective epithelia differs considerably, the VNO-NE is approximately 170 $\mu$m tall and the OE is only about 90 $\mu$m. The receptors of the VNO-NE lack olfactory knobs which are typically found in the sensory cells of the OE. The perikarya of the receptor cells of the VNO-NE are very large when compared to those of the sensory cells of the OE. In contrast to the OE, blood vessels are found within the neuroepithelial layer of the VNO. The progenitor cells of the OE are located in a clearly distinguishable cell layer which is lacking in the rodent VNO-NE. The differences between the two epithelial layers become more obvious at the electron microscopical level. The olfactory knobs of the sensory cell dendrites of the OE reach the nasal cavity with numerous cilia. These olfactory hairs, on average 11 per knob, consist of a short proximal segment and a long and thin distal segment. This distal segment runs parallel to the epithelial surface and is embedded in the neuroepithelial mucosal layer. The dendrites of the receptor cells of the VNO-NE reach the lumen of the VNO with numerous branched microvilli which are also embedded in the mucous layer. Horizontal ultrathin sections through the apical portion of the OE reveal that each supporting cell completely envelopes several dendrites. This glia-like relationship is not found in the corresponding layer of the VNO-NE. The sensory cell perikarya of the OE contain only a few endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) profiles while the receptor cells of the VNO are characterized by an extensive smooth endoplasmatic reticulum (SER). In contrast to the fila olfactoria, numerous axons within the vomeronasal nerve show ellipsoidal varicosities without synaptic vesicles which may indicate the existence of at least two vomeronasal nerve fibers. The cytoarchitectonic differences between the OE of the MOS and the VNO-NE, the sensory field of the AOS, described in the present study add to the body of morphological knowledge of these organs and aid in the understanding of the specific functioning of the respective systems. {\textcopyright} 1993, Gustav Fischer Verlag Jena GmbH.

abstract = {The mammalian olfactory system is not uniformly organized but consists of several subsystems each of which probably serves distinct functions. Not only are the two major nasal chemosensory systems, the vomeronasal organ and the main olfactory epithelium, structurally and functionally separate entities, but the latter is further subcompartimentalized into overlapping expression zones and projection-related subzones. Moreover, the populations of 'OR37' neurons not only express a unique type of olfactory receptors but also are segregated in a cluster-like manner and generally project to only one receptor-specific glomerulus. The septal organ is an island of sensory epithelium on the nasal septum positioned at the nasoplatine duct; it is considered as a 'mini-nose' with dual function. A specific chemosensory function of the most recently discovered subsystem, the so-called Grueneberg ganglion, is based on the expression of olfactory marker protein and the axonal projections to defined glomeruli within the olfactory bulb. This complexity of distinct olfactory subsystems may be one of the features determining the enormous chemosensory capacity of the sense of smell. {\textcopyright} Birkh{\"{a}}user Verlag, 2006.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate the occurrence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. Methods: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were recruited from 12 European hospitals. The following epidemiological and clinical outcomes have been studied: age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and general and otolaryngological symptoms. Patients completed olfactory and gustatory questionnaires based on the smell and taste component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS). Results: A total of 417 mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients completed the study (263 females). The most prevalent general symptoms consisted of cough, myalgia, and loss of appetite. Face pain and nasal obstruction were the most disease-related otolaryngological symptoms. 85.6{\%} and 88.0{\%} of patients reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, respectively. There was a significant association between both disorders (p {\textless} 0.001). Olfactory dysfunction (OD) appeared before the other symptoms in 11.8{\%} of cases. The sQO-NS scores were significantly lower in patients with anosmia compared with normosmic or hyposmic individuals (p = 0.001). Among the 18.2{\%} of patients without nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea, 79.7{\%} were hyposmic or anosmic. The early olfactory recovery rate was 44.0{\%}. Females were significantly more affected by olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions than males (p = 0.001). Conclusion: Olfactory and gustatory disorders are prevalent symptoms in European COVID-19 patients, who may not have nasal symptoms. The sudden anosmia or ageusia need to be recognized by the international scientific community as important symptoms of the COVID-19 infection.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein‚àíprotein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ‚â§ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The core objective of the EPOS2020 guideline is to provide revised, up-to-date and clear evidence-based recommendations and integrated care pathways in ARS and CRS. EPOS2020 provides an update on the literature published and studies undertaken in the eight years since the EPOS2012 position paper was published and addresses areas not extensively covered in EPOS2012 such as paediatric CRS and sinus surgery. EPOS2020 also involves new stakeholders, including pharmacists and patients, and addresses new target users who have become more involved in the management and treatment of rhinosinusitis since the publication of the last EPOS document, including pharmacists, nurses, specialised care givers and indeed patients themselves, who employ increasing self-management of their condition using over the counter treatments. The document provides suggestions for future research in this area and offers updated guidance for definitions and outcome measurements in research in different settings. EPOS2020 contains chapters on definitions and classification where we have defined a large number of terms and indicated preferred terms. A new classification of CRS into primary and secondary CRS and further division into localized and diffuse disease, based on anatomic distribution is proposed. There are extensive chapters on epidemiology and predisposing factors, inflammatory mechanisms, (differential) diagnosis of facial pain, allergic rhinitis, genetics, cystic fibrosis, aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease, immunodeficiencies, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis and the relationship between upper and lower airways. The chapters on paediatric acute and chronic rhinosinusitis are totally rewritten. All available evidence for the management of acute rhinosinusitis and chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps in adults and children is systematically reviewed and integrated care pathways based on the evidence are proposed. Despite considerable increases in the amount of quality publications in recent years, a large number of practical clinical questions remain. It was agreed that the best way to address these was to conduct a Delphi exercise . The results have been integrated into the respective sections. Last but not least, advice for patients and pharmacists and a new list of research needs are included.

abstract = {BACKGROUND SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, is responsible for the largest pandemic since the 1918 H1N1 influenza outbreak. The symptoms presently recognized by the World Health Organization are cough, fever, tiredness, and difficulty breathing. Patient-reported smell and taste loss has been associated with COVID-19 infection, yet no empirical olfactory testing on a cohort of COVID-19 patients has been performed. METHODS The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), a well-validated 40-odorant test, was administered to 60 confirmed COVID-19 inpatients and 60 age- and sex-matched controls to assess the magnitude and frequency of their olfactory dysfunction. A mixed effects analysis of variance determined whether meaningful differences in test scores existed between the two groups and if the test scores were differentially influenced by sex. RESULTS Fifty-nine (98{\%}) of the 60 patients exhibited some smell dysfunction [mean (95{\%} CI) UPSIT score: 20.98 (19.47,22.48); controls: 34.10 (33.31,34.88); p{\textless}0.0001]. Thirty-five of the 60 patients (58{\%}) were either anosmic (15/60; 25{\%}) or severely microsmic (20/60; 33{\%}); 16 exhibited moderate microsmia (16/60; 27{\%}), 8 mild microsmia (8/60; 13{\%}), and one normosmia (1/60; 2{\%}). Deficits were evident for all 40 UPSIT odorants. No meaningful relationships between the test scores and sex, disease severity, or comorbidities were found. CONCLUSIONS Quantitative smell testing demonstrates that decreased smell function, but not always anosmia, is a major marker for SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggests the possibility that smell testing may help, in some cases, to identify COVID-19 patients in need of early treatment or quarantine.

As the portal of entry for the respiratory tract, the upper airway's sentinel function is performed by the olfactory and trigeminal nerves. Sensory (eye, nose and throat) irritation figures prominently in symptom reporting in so-called "problem buildings," as well as in industrial exposures to irritant gases, vapors, and smokes. Both irritants and allergens can alter function in the upper airway, leading to loss of air conditioning and filtering due to airflow obstruction and hypersecretion. Increasing evidence points to a "unified airway" model of pathogenesis (in which rhinitis may precede the development of asthma).

abstract = {Conclusions: The olfactory and intranasal trigeminal systems are closely connected. With regard to intranasal trigeminal event-related potential (ERP), patients with olfactory dysfunction (OD) showed longer latency and lower amplitude, which indicated decreased trigeminal sensitivity. Different age, etiology, and olfactory status also affect trigeminal sensitivity differently. Objective: OD is a common symptom in the rhinology clinic. ERP is considered an important method to evaluate chemosensitivity. The aim of this study was to investigate changes of intranasal trigeminal sense in patients with postviral OD (PVOD) and post-traumatic OD (PTOD). Methods: A total of 96 participants (30 healthy adults and 66 patients with OD) aged 2065 years were investigated. The T{\&}T olfactometer, the Sniffin' Sticks olfactory test, and trigeminal ERPs (tERPs) were used. We evaluated trigeminal sensitivity influenced by different factors (age, etiology, and olfactory status) in healthy subjects with normal olfactory function and in patients with PVOD and PTOD. Results: Patients with OD showed higher trigeminal thresholds than normal controls. Compared with controls, N1/P2 latencies of tERPs increased and amplitudes decreased in patients with OD. Older subjects showed longer latencies and lower amplitudes than young subjects in both controls and the OD group. Patients with PTOD exhibited worse psychophysical olfactory function and decreased trigeminal sensitivity. {\textcopyright} 2012 Informa Healthcare.},

abstract = {Background: Viral rhinitis (the ‚Äúcommon‚Äù cold) is a frequent worldwide disease. Olfactory dysfunction is one complication that arises during infection, which in most cases heals up spontaneously upon recovery, whereas in some cases it may persist as a partial or total loss of olfaction. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the change of other chemosensory systems during a cold. Methods: Fifty-eight patients (age 18 to 69 years) with an acute cold were compared to a healthy control group (n = 59; age 19 to 63 years). All patients were examined on 2 occasions separated by approximately 4 weeks. Orthonasal, retronasal, gustatory, and trigeminal nasal function were investigated. Furthermore, ratings of real foods, in terms of intensity and pleasantness, were obtained. Results: Compared to the control group, patients showed a decreased orthonasal (threshold and discrimination) and retronasal function. Furthermore, patients exhibited a decreased sensitivity to salt and a reduced ability to localize menthol, indicating a decreased taste and trigeminal function, respectively. Upon recovery from the infection, orthonasal olfactory and trigeminal sensitivity increased, whereas retronasal sensitivity showed no improvement and salt sensitivity decreased. Conclusion: This comprehensive study provides empirical evidence that chemosensory impairment is prevalent during a cold, and additionally shows for the first time that chemosensory features associated with food consumption persist postinfection.},

abstract = {Trigeminal nerve endings of the human nasal mucosa are activated by chemical, physical or thermal stimuli. Activation of these Adelta and C fibers can be quantified through the recording of chemo-somatosensory event-related potentials (ERP). The aim of this study was to investigate whether allergy-related activation of trigeminal nerve endings leads to changes in their responsiveness to intranasal trigeminal stimulation. Gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) stimuli were applied in three sessions (baseline, after NaCl solution and after allergen application) to the nasal mucosa of 13 subjects with allergic rhinitis. Chemo-somatosensory ERP were recorded, and subjects rated the intensity of rhinitis symptoms. Administration of allergen produced a significant shortening of chemo-somatosensory ERP peak latencies P1 and N1. Observed changes of latencies were in line with rhinitis symptoms subjects indicated during the session. In addition, there was a negative relation between the general symptom score and ERP peak latencies, obtained both at baseline and after allergen exposure. In conclusion, it is hypothesized that in patients suffering from allergic rhinitis, nasal itching and sneezing after allergen exposure are, at least in part, clinical correlates of the activation of trigeminal nerve endings due to local inflammatory mechanisms. The correlations between ERP latencies and the patients' symptoms indicate that ERP latencies may possess a predictive value of the subjects' responsiveness to allergens. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract = {Multiple subsets of nociceptive, parasympathetic, and sympathetic nerves innervate human nasal mucosa. These play carefully coordinated roles in regulating glandular, vascular, and other processes. These functions are vital for cleaning and humidifying ambient air before it is inhaled into the lungs. The recent identification of distinct classes of nociceptive nerves with unique patterns of transient receptor potential sensory receptor ion channel proteins may account for the polymodal, chemo- and mechanicosensitivity of many trigeminal neurons. Modulation of these families of proteins, excitatory and inhibitory autoreceptors, and combinations of neurotransmitters introduces a new level of complexity and subtlety to nasal innervation. These findings may provide a rational basis for responses to air-temperature changes, culinary and botanical odorants ("aromatherapy"), and inhaled irritants in conditions as diverse as allergic and nonallergic rhinitis, occupational rhinitis, hyposmia, and multiple chemical sensitivity. {\textcopyright} 2009 New York Academy of Sciences.},

Methods: This study was based on 240 patients, with olfactory loss caused only by flu or a cold. We excluded all patients with concomitant illness (66 patients), the rest of patients (n = 174) consisted of 51 men (29.3{\%}) and 123 women (70.7{\%}). They all underwent olfactometry study (i and v cranial nerve) and a nasal sinus computed tomography scan, as well as magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Results were compared with a control group (n = 120). Results: Very significant differences in levels of olfactory impairment for the olfactory nerve (P {\textless} .00001) and trigeminal nerve (P {\textless} .0001) were confirmed.

abstract = {Background. Respiratory viruses account for most respiratory infections. Although analysis of epidemiologic information regarding viral seasonality, sites of transmission and susceptible populations is essential to devising strategies for limiting epidemics, few long term epidemiologic studies have addressed these questions. Methods. Epidemiologic findings identifying susceptible populations, as well as temporal and geographic patterns of infection with influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus and parainfluenza virus were reviewed. Conclusions. Influenza is the virus most frequently associated with outbreaks of respiratory infection resulting in medical consultation as well as virus-related lethality. Similar symptom profiles and overlapping seasonality of respiratory syncytial virus and other viruses may sometimes complicate surveillance and treatment. Although vaccination and antiviral drugs are virus-specific, factors that promote transmission and thus strategies for limiting outbreaks are similar for various respiratory viruses.},

abstract = {Hypothesis: We investigated whether olfactory dysfunction following infections of the upper respiratory tract (post-URTI) has an incidence matching the seasonality of URTIs. Study design: Retrospective study. Methods: In total, 457 patients (126 male, 331 female) with post-URTI olfactory loss were examined during a 6-year-period (1999-2004). Their records were assessed for age, sex, and time of onset of the disease. The severity of olfactory dysfunction was assessed using the "Sniffin' Sticks" (odour threshold, odour discrimination, and odour identification). Results: Incidence of post-URTI olfactory dysfunction exhibited seasonal fluctuations with deviations from the winter seasonality of URTIs. The overall incidence of the disease differed significantly between months. March (12.7{\%}) and May (12.6{\%}) were the months with the highest incidence of the disease throughout the year. The lowest incidence was observed in September (5.6{\%}). Significant differences were found between these months and months with a high incidence of URTIs. Discussion: The peak incidence of post-URTI olfactory loss in March may be explained by the high incidence of influenza at this time. However, it is unclear why the incidence of the disease presents a second peak in May, when the incidence of respiratory viruses is relatively low. Climate conditions at this time might play a role in the susceptibility of the nasal epithelia towards certain viral infections, e.g. parainfluenza type III. Conclusion: Post-URTI olfactory dysfunction exh ibits spring seasonality with peaks in March and May and possible causative factors being influenza and parainfluenza viruses (type III), respectively.},

Design: Assessment of olfactory symptoms and function in patients with a chief complaint of parosmia. Setting: A university hospital clinic and research facility. Patients: Fifty-six consecutive patients presented to the ORL Clinic, European Hospital Georges Pompidou, with a chief complaint of parosmia between October 2001 and November 2003. Main Outcome Measures: Subjective olfactory symptom analysis and olfactory function test results. Results: The mean duration of parosmia was 63.0 months. Forty patients (71.4{\%}) reported associated hyposmia and 16 (28.6{\%}) reported anosmia. Olfactory testing revealed moderate to severe olfactory loss in all patients. Quantitative and qualitative alterations occurred simultaneously in 32 patients (57.1{\%}); parosmia onset occurred within 3 months after quantitative dysosmia in 19 patients (33.9{\%}) and after 3 months in 5 patients (8.9{\%}). The sensation of parosmia was always unpleasant. The main odorant triggers eliciting parosmia are described. The mean severity of flavor dysfunction of the population, evaluated using a 10-cm visual analog scale, was 6.4. Thirty-one patients (55.4{\%}) viewed their olfactory alteration as severely affecting their quality of life.

However, few studies are found in the medical literature on taste disorders, including authoritative textbooks of neurology and internal medicine. One reason for this may be that gustatory functions are tied to the sense of smell, the somatosensory system, and the perception of pain (eg, when spicy food is eaten), which makes it difficult to examine sensations mediated through an individual system.

Some chemosensory complaints are due to the sensory properties of the drug itself such as aversive bitter and metallic tastes. However, most chemosensory side effects of drugs are due to alterations in the transduction pathways, biochemical targets, enzymes, and transporters by the offending medications. Studies of chemosensory perception in medicated older individuals have found that taste and smell loss is greatest for those consuming the largest number of prescription drugs. There are no standard treatments for drug-induced chemosensory disorders because each drug has unique biological effects. However, there are a few treatment options to ameliorate chemosensory alterations including addition of simulated flavors to food to compensate for losses and to override offending tastes and smells.},

abstract = {The quantitative effects of radiation and age on taste structure (number of taste buds and number of taste cells per bud) in mice and on taste acuity in therapeutically irradiated humans have been studied. After localized head irradiation, both number of buds and number of cells per bud fall rapidly to a minimum about 9 days later, with recovery to normal by about day 20; the 50{\%} exposure is about 1.5 kR of x-rays. Taste-cell lifetime in the bud is brief, only 10 1/2 days. In mice, aging from young adulthood to extreme old age causes about a 30{\%} decrease in number of buds. Humans treated with fractionated therapeutic irradiation (about 6 kR total exposure) to the head and neck suffer a 75 to 99{\%} decrease in their taste acuity to sugar, acid, and quinine. This loss develops during irradiation (about 6 weeks); preirradiation acuity is recovered within 60 to 100 days after irradiation ends.

We examined the prevalence and associated risk factors of self-reported chemosensory alterations in 3603 community-dwelling adults (aged 40+ years), from the nationally representative, US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2012. In this new NHANES component, technicians surveyed adults in the home about perceived smell and taste problems, distortions, and diminished abilities since age 25 (termed "alterations"), and chemosensory-related health risks and behaviors. The prevalence of self-reported smell alteration was 23{\%}, including phantosmia at 6{\%}; taste was 19{\%}, including dysgeusia at 5{\%}. Prevalence rates increased progressively with age, highest in those aged 80+ years (smell, 32{\%}; taste, 27{\%}). In multivariable logistic regression, controlling for sociodemographics, health behaviors, and chemosensory-related conditions, the strongest independent risk factor for smell alteration was sinonasal symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 2.06; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 1.63-2.61), followed by heavy drinking, loss of consciousness from head injury, family income ‚â§110{\%} poverty threshold, and xerostomia. For taste, the strongest risk factor was xerostomia (OR = 2.65; 95{\%} CI: 1.97-3.56), followed by nose/facial injury, lower educational attainment, and fair/poor health. Self-reported chemosensory alterations are prevalent in US adults, supporting increased attention to decreasing their modifiable risks, managing safety/health consequences, and expanding chemosensory screening/testing and treatments.},

Growing anecdotal evidence suggests increasing incidence of cases of anosmia during the current pandemic, suggesting that COVID-19 may cause olfactory dysfunction. The objective was to characterise patients reporting new onset anosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic METHODOLOGY: Design: Survey of 2428 patients reporting new onset anosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic. SETTING Volunteer sample of patients seeking medical advice of recent onset self-diagnosed loss of sense of smell RESULTS: 2428 surveys were completed within 7 days; 64{\%} respondents were under 40. The majority of respondents reported onset of their anosmia in the last week. Of the cohort, 17{\%} did not report any other symptom thought to be associated with COVID-19. In patients who reported other symptoms, 51{\%} reported either cough or fever and therefore met current guidelines for self-isolation. CONCLUSIONS Anosmia is reported in conjunction with well-reported symptoms of coronas virus, but 1 in 6 patients with recent onset anosmia report this as an isolated symptom. This might help identify otherwise asymptomatic carriers of disease and trigger targeted testing. Further study with COVID-19 testing is required to identify the proportion of patients in whom new onset anosmia can be attributed to COVID-19.},

abstract = {Background: Olfactory and gustatory functions have not been well characterized in older adults in the US. Consequently, their relationships to sociodemographic characteristics, as well as physical and mental health, were studied in a large national probability sample (n = 3005) using brief validated tests of chemosensory function. Methods: A five-odour identification test and taste-impregnated strips of filter paper (sweet, sour, bitter, and salty) assessed the ability to identify chemosensory stimuli. Results: Severe gustatory dysfunction (14.8{\%}) was more prevalent than severe olfactory dysfunction (2.7{\%}). Age, education and sex were independently associated with performance on both the olfactory and gustatory identification tasks. Higher scores were associated with female sex, higher level of education, and lower age. Odour identification scores exhibited a positive, albeit weak, correlation with BMI, and food-related odours were better identified than non-food odours. In addition, odour identification performance was also negatively associated with depressive symptoms. Conclusions: These data demonstrate a high prevalence of severe gustatory and, to a somewhat lesser extent, olfactory dysfunction in a population-based sample and demonstrate that even brief tests are capable of detecting correlations between both chemical senses and relevant health measures outside a clinical setting.},

This paper reports the application in a clinical setting of the European Test of Olfactory Capabilities (ETOC), combining odor detection and identification. The study included three phases. In phase 1, anosmics, hyposmics and controls were tested with the 16-items version of the ETOC. In phase 2, a short version of the ETOC was developed: patients with and controls without olfactory impairment were tested on a 6-items ETOC. In phase 3, to predict olfactory impairments in new individuals, the 16-items ETOC was administered on samples of young and older adults, and the 6-items version was applied in samples of young, elderly participants and Alzheimer patients. In phase 1, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) of ETOC scores classified patients and controls with 87.5¬†{\%} accuracy. In phase 2, LDA provided 84¬†{\%} correct classification. Results of phase 3 revealed: (1) 16-items ETOC: whereas in young adults, 10¬†{\%} were classified as hyposmic and 90¬†{\%} as normosmic, in elderly, 1¬†{\%} were classified as anosmic, 39¬†{\%} hyposmic and 60¬†{\%} normosmic; (2) 6-items ETOC: 15¬†{\%} of the young adults were classified as having olfactory impairment, compared to 28¬†{\%} in the older group and 83¬†{\%} in Alzheimer patients. In conclusion, the ETOC enables characterizing the prevalence of olfactory impairment in young subjects and in normal and pathological aging. Whereas the 16-items ETOC is more discriminant, the short ETOC may provide a fast (5‚Äì10¬†min) tool to assess olfaction in clinical settings.},

abstract = {Background: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) in old age is associated with poor health outcomes. Interrelationships among different correlates of OD can offer insights into the underlying mechanisms, but to date remain understudied. Methods: Odor identification performance and self-reported olfactory functioning were studied in 2,234 people aged 60-90 years, who were free of neurodegenerative disease and enrolled in the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K) study, Stockholm, Sweden. OD was defined as the inability to identify more than 10 out of 16 odors (free or cued identification) in a standardized odor identification task. OD prevalence was estimated, and associations with demographic, genetic, vascular, clinical, and behavioral factors, as well as their interactions were examined using multiple logistic regression analyses. Results: Overall prevalence of OD was 24.8{\%} (CI: 23.1; 26.6). Self-reports were characterized by low sensitivity (35{\%}), but high specificity (87{\%}). Advancing age (OR = 15.50, CI = 9.40; 26.10 between the first and last age group), and history of coronary heart disease (OR = 1.35, 95{\%} CI = 1.04; 1.75) were the principal factors associated with an increased probability of OD, whereas female gender (OR = 0.53, 95{\%} CI = 0.43; 0.66) and more years of education (OR = 0.97, CI 0.94; 0.99) were linked to a lower probability. Exploratory interaction analyses indicated that prevalence of OD was particularly elevated among Apolipropotein E (APOE) 4 allele carriers who were also obese, and that being physically active counteracted the negative impact of cerebrovascular disease on OD. Conclusion: Demographic and genetic factors, but also prior and current health insults, are linked to OD in old age. Modulatory effects of behavioral factors highlight their value as possible prevention targets.},

Two versions of the ETOC, one easy and one less easy, were used to test the olfactory performance of European citizens in three countries (France, Sweden and the Netherlands).

In the majority of patients, a reduced sense of smell was found after testing. Often, but not always, this was combined with qualitative disorders. Dominating etiologies were infections, nasal polyposis, head trauma, and aging.

abstract = {Age-associated loss of olfactory function, or presbyosmia, has been described in many studies of olfactory ability. Presbyosmia has been ascribed to idiopathic causes despite recognition that many neurodegenerative diseases also induce loss of olfactory function and increase in incidence in the aged population. Often this olfactory loss is unnoticed or unreported by affected individuals. More effective olfactory function in women compared with men is another common feature of many studies of olfactory function. Here we report on normative data from an Australian population study (n = 942) that has been divided into 2 subpopulations and reassessed as (included) a population of healthy, nonmedicated, nonsmokers with no history of nasal problems (n = 485) and (excluded) a population of participants who were either medicated, smokers or had a history of nasal problems (n = 457). The "included" data set shows a strong relationship between self-reporting of olfactory sensitivity and olfactory function score. The included data set shows a small but significant decline in olfactory ability after 65 years of age and better olfactory function in females compared with males. Data from the excluded population show a marked decline in olfactory ability after 65 years of age, no difference between males and females, and a weak relationship between self-reporting of olfactory function and actual olfactory function. The power of this approach is that it provides a normative data set against which many factors such as medication schedules and pathological conditions can be compared. {\textcopyright} 2006 Oxford University Press.},

The identification test used common odorous items (e.g., baby powder and ground coffee) and pungent items (e.g., ammonia) to test trigeminal function. A list of odor names and use of corrective feedback during testing overcame word-finding difficulty in odor identification. Each test readily distinguished between patients and control subjects.

abstract = {Clinically, olfaction can fail in any of three ways: (i) decreased sensitivity (hyposmia, anosmia) and two types of distortion (dysosmia); (ii) distorted quality of an odorant stimulation (troposmia); (iii) perceived odor when no odorant is present (phantosmia, hallucination). The distortions are usually much more upsetting to a person's quality of life than a simple loss. An ipsilatersal loss of olfactory sensitivity is often identified in the nostril with any type of olfactory distortion. The pathophysiology of a stimulated distortion (troposmia) is likely a decreased number of functioning olfactory primary neurons so that an incomplete characterization of the odorant is made. In phantosmia, two possible causations include an abnormal signal or inhibition from the primary olfactory neurons or peripheral olfactory or trigeminal signals that "trigger" a central process. The clinician's goal is to carefully define the problem (e.g. taste versus smell, real versus perceived, one versus two nostrils), to perform the appropriate examination and testing and to provide therapy if possible. Treatment includes assurance with no active therapy (because many of these will naturally resolve), topical medications, systemic medications, anesthesia to parts of the nose and, rarely, referral for surgical excision of olfactory neurons.

abstract = {Background:Population-based studies for olfactory dysfunction are lacking. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of subjective olfactory dysfunction and its risk factors in the Korean general population.Methods:The data were obtained from the 2009 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), which was a cross-sectional survey of non-institutionalized population all around the country (n = 10,533). All interviewees underwent medical interviews, physical examinations, endoscopic examination and blood/urine tests. Whether sense of smell has been normal or abnormal during the last 3 months was asked. Complete olfaction data were obtained from 7,306 participants and the participants were divided into normosmic and hyposmic group. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify its risk factors.Results:The weighted prevalence of subjective olfactory dysfunction was 4.5{\%}. Its increased prevalence was significantly associated with the increasing age for both men and women. In the multivariate analyses, low income (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.43, 95{\%} Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.01-2.03), habitual exposure to air pollutants (adjusted OR = 2.18, CI = 1.33-3.55), a history of hepatitis B (adjusted OR = 3.10, CI = 1.25-7.68), rhinitis (adjusted OR = 1.78, CI = 1.26-2.51) and chronic sinusitis (adjusted OR = 14.55, CI = 10.06-21.05) were risk factors of olfactory dysfunction.Conclusion:Our population-based study showed that olfactory dysfunction was quite prevalent and several risk factors were associated with impaired sense of smell. Given its prevalence, further researches for its prevention and management are required. {\textcopyright} 2013 Lee et al.},

To investigate the potential route of 2019-nCov infection on the mucosa of oral cavity, bulk RNA-seq profiles from two public databases including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Functional Annotation of The Mammalian Genome Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (FANTOM5 CAGE) dataset were collected. RNA-seq profiling data of 13 organ types with para-carcinoma normal tissues from TCGA and 14 organ types with normal tissues from FANTOM5 CAGE were analyzed in order to explore and validate the expression of ACE2 on the mucosa of oral cavity. Further, single-cell transcriptomes from an independent data generated in-house were used to identify and confirm the ACE2-expressing cell composition and proportion in oral cavity. The results demonstrated that the ACE2 expressed on the mucosa of oral cavity. Interestingly, this receptor was highly enriched in epithelial cells of tongue. Preliminarily, those findings have explained the basic mechanism that the oral cavity is a potentially high risk for 2019-nCoV infectious susceptibility and provided a piece of evidence for the future prevention strategy in dental clinical practice as well as daily life.},

abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the etiologic agent responsible for COVID-19 coronavirus disease, is a global threat. To better understand viral tropism, we assessed the RNA expression of the coronavirus receptor, ACE2, as well as the viral S protein priming protease TMPRSS2 thought to govern viral entry in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from healthy individuals generated by the Human Cell Atlas consortium. We found that ACE2, as well as the protease TMPRSS2, are differentially expressed in respiratory and gut epithelial cells. In-depth analysis of epithelial cells in the respiratory tree reveals that nasal epithelial cells, specifically goblet/secretory cells and ciliated cells, display the highest ACE2 expression of all the epithelial cells analyzed. The skewed expression of viral receptors/entry-associated proteins towards the upper airway may be correlated with enhanced transmissivity. Finally, we showed that many of the top genes associated with ACE2 airway epithelial expression are innate immune-associated, antiviral genes, highly enriched in the nasal epithelial cells. This association with immune pathways might have clinical implications for the course of infection and viral pathology, and highlights the specific significance of nasal epithelia in viral infection. Our findings underscore the importance of the availability of the Human Cell Atlas as a reference dataset. In this instance, analysis of the compendium of data points to a particularly relevant role for nasal goblet and ciliated cells as early viral targets and potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This, in turn, serves as a biological framework for dissecting viral transmission and developing clinical strategies for prevention and therapy.},

Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence. We did a Review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases. Of 3166 papers found, 24 are included in this Review. Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.},

We analyzed key parameters of epidemic spread to estimate the contribution of different transmission routes and determine requirements for case isolation and contact-tracing needed to stop the epidemic. We conclude that viral spread is too fast to be contained by manual contact tracing, but could be controlled if this process was faster, more efficient and happened at scale. A contact-tracing App which builds a memory of proximity contacts and immediately notifies contacts of positive cases can achieve epidemic control if used by enough people. By targeting recommendations to only those at risk, epidemics could be contained without need for mass quarantines (‚Äòlock-downs') that are harmful to society.

These patients with such a qualitative smell disorder are often more severely affected than patients exhibiting only a quantitative smell disorder. Qualitative smell disorders have heretofore been poorly investigated. The focus of the present study was, using functional MRI, to compare the central processing of olfactory stimulation in patients with qualitative smell disorders. Material and Methods: A total of 23 patients were investigated, 12 hyposmic patients without parosmia (HYP group) and 11 hyposmic patients with parosmia (PAR group). Both groups were matched with regard to sex and age. The olfactory smells used were peach and coffee odors. Results: The two groups exhibited different patterns of activation. In HYP patients a stronger activation was observed in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and parahippocampal gyrus, whereas in the PAR group stronger activation in the thalamus and putamen was seen. Discussion: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that there are specific patterns in the central processing of olfactory stimuli which differ in hyposmic patients with and without parosmia.},

abstract = {Taste loss in human patients following radiotherapy for head and neck cancer is a common and significant problem, but the cellular mechanisms underlying this loss are not understood. Taste stimuli are transduced by receptor cells within taste buds, and like epidermal cells, taste cells are regularly replaced throughout adult life. This renewal relies on progenitor cells adjacent to taste buds, which continually supply new cells to each bud. Here we treated adult mice with a single 8 Gy dose of x-ray irradiation to the head and neck, and analyzed taste epithelium at 1-21 d postirradiation (dpi).Wefound irradiation targets the taste progenitor cells, which undergo cell cycle arrest (1-3 dpi) and apoptosis (within 1 dpi). Taste progenitors resume proliferation at 5-7 dpi, with the proportion of cells in S and M phase exceeding control levels at 5-6 and 6 dpi, respectively, suggesting that proliferation is accelerated and/or synchronized following radiation damage. Using 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine birthdating to identify newborn cells, we found that the decreased proliferation following irradiation reduces the influx of cells at 1-2 dpi, while the robust proliferation detected at 6 dpi accelerates entry of new cells into taste buds. In contrast, the number of differentiated taste cells was not significantly reduced until 7 dpi. These data suggest a model where continued natural taste cell death, paired with temporary interruption of cell replacement, underlies taste loss after irradiation. {\textcopyright} 2012 the authors.},

Design: Cross-sectional population-based survey, distributing four microencapsulated odorants (rose, banana, musk and gas) and two self-administered questionnaires (odour description; epidemiology/health status). Setting: The survey was distributed to general population through a bilingual (Catalan, Spanish) newspaper in Catalonia (Spain), on December 2003. Participants: Newspaper readers of all ages and gender; 9348 surveys were analysed from the 10 783 returned. Main outcome measures: Characteristics of surveyed population, olfaction by age and gender, smell self-perception and smell impairment risk factors. Terms normosmia, hyposmia and anosmia were used when participants detected, recognised or identified all four, one to three or none of the odours, respectively. Results: Survey profile was a 43-year-old woman with medium-high educational level, living in a city. Olfaction was considered normal in 80.6{\%} (detection), 56{\%} (recognition/memory) and 50.7{\%} (identification). Prevalence of smell dysfunction was 19.4{\%} for detection (0.3{\%} anosmia, 19.1{\%} hyposmia), 43.5{\%} for recognition (0.2{\%} anosmia, 43.3{\%} hyposmia) and 48.8{\%} for identification (0.8{\%} anosmia, 48{\%} hyposmia). Olfaction was worse (p{\textless}0.0001) in men than in women through all ages. There was a significant age-related smell detection decline however smell recognition and identification increased up to fourth decade and declined after the sixth decade of life. Risk factors for anosmia were: male gender, loss of smell history and poor olfactory self-perception for detection; low educational level, poor self-perception and pregnancy for recognition; and older age, poor self-perception and history of head trauma and loss of smell for identification. Smoking and exposure to noxious substances were mild protective factors for smell recognition. Conclusions: Sense of smell in women is better than in men suggesting a learning process during life with deterioration in older ages. Poor self-perception, history of smell loss, head trauma and pregnancy are potential risk factors for olfactory disorders.},

Moreover, lung cells that have ACE2 expression may be the main target cells during 2019-nCoV infection. However, some patients also exhibit non-respiratory symptoms, such as kidney failure, implying that 2019-nCoV could also invade other organs. To construct a risk map of different human organs, we analyzed the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets derived from major human physiological systems, including the respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive, and urinary systems. Through scRNA-seq data analyses, we identified the organs at risk, such as lung, heart, esophagus, kidney, bladder, and ileum, and located specific cell types (i.e., type II alveolar cells (AT2), myocardial cells, proximal tubule cells of the kidney, ileum and esophagus epithelial cells, and bladder urothelial cells), which are vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection. Based on the findings, we constructed a risk map indicating the vulnerability of different organs to 2019-nCoV infection.

abstract = {Infection of humans with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) results in substantial morbidity and mortality, with death resulting primarily from respiratory failure. While the lungs are the major site of infection, the brain is also infected in some patients. Brain infection may result in long-term neurological sequelae, but little is known about the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV in this organ. We previously showed that the brain was a major target organ for infection in mice that are transgenic for the SARS-CoV receptor (human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). Herein, we use these mice to show that virus enters the brain primarily via the olfactory bulb, and infection results in rapid, transneuronal spread to connected areas of the brain. This extensive neuronal infection is the main cause of death because intracranial inoculation with low doses of virus results in a uniformly lethal disease even though little infection is detected in the lungs. Death of the animal likely results from dysfunction and/or death of infected neurons, especially those located in cardiorespiratory centers in the medulla. Remarkably, the virus induces minimal cellular infiltration in the brain. Our results show that neurons are a highly susceptible target for SARS-CoV and that only the absence of the host cell receptor prevents severe murine brain disease.},

Neurologic manifestations fell into 3 categories: Central nervous system manifestations (dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, and seizure), peripheral nervous system manifestations (taste impairment, smell impairment, vision impairment, and nerve pain), and skeletal muscular injury manifestations. Results: Of 214 patients (mean [SD] age, 52.7 [15.5] years; 87 men [40.7{\%}]) with COVID-19, 126 patients (58.9{\%}) had nonsevere infection and 88 patients (41.1{\%}) had severe infection according to their respiratory status. Overall, 78 patients (36.4{\%}) had neurologic manifestations. Compared with patients with nonsevere infection, patients with severe infection were older, had more underlying disorders, especially hypertension, and showed fewer typical symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever and cough. Patients with more severe infection had neurologic manifestations, such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (5 [5.7{\%}] vs 1 [0.8{\%}]), impaired consciousness (13 [14.8{\%}] vs 3 [2.4{\%}]), and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3{\%}] vs 6 [4.8{\%}]). Conclusions and Relevance: Patients with COVID-19 commonly have neurologic manifestations. During the epidemic period of COVID-19, when seeing patients with neurologic manifestations, clinicians should suspect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection as a differential diagnosis to avoid delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis and lose the chance to treat and prevent further transmission..},

abstract = {Previous results suggested that, after intranasal inoculation, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a neurotropic coronavirus, entered the central nervous system (CNS) via the olfactory and trigeminal nerves. To prove this hypothesis, the effect of interruption of the olfactory pathway on spread of the virus was studied using in situ hybridization. Unilateral surgical ablation of this pathway prevented spread of the virus via the olfactory tract on the side of the lesion. MHV RNA could be detected, however, at distal sites on the operated side, indicating that the virus spread via well-described circuits involving the anterior commissure from the control (intact) side of the brain. Viral transport via the trigeminal nerve was not affected by removal of the olfactory bulb, showing that the surgical procedure was specific for the olfactory pathway. These results prove conclusively that MHV gains entry to the CNS via a transneuronal route, and spreads to additional sites in the brain via known neuroanatomic pathways. {\textcopyright} 1990, Rockefeller University Press., All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In recent years, considerable progress has been achieved in the comprehension of the profound effects of pheromones on reproductive physiology and behavior. Pheromones have been classified as molecules released by individuals and responsible for the elicitation of specific behavioral expressions in members of the same species. These signaling molecules, often chemically unrelated, are contained in body fluids like urine, sweat, specialized exocrine glands, and mucous secretions of genitals. The standard view of pheromone sensing was based on the assumption that most mammals have two separated olfactory systems with different functional roles: the main olfactory system for recognizing conventional odorant molecules and the vomeronasal system specifically dedicated to the detection of pheromones. However, recent studies have reexamined this traditional interpretation showing that both the main olfactory and the vomeronasal systems are actively involved in pheromonal communication. The current knowledge on the behavioral, physiological, and molecular aspects of pheromone detection in mammals is discussed in this review.

For both stimulus types, we observed signal changes only in the ipsilateral ganglion, and activation occurred somatotopically, as predicted by the known anatomical segregation of the neurons comprising the ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2), and mandibular (V3) divisions of the nerve. Signal decreased after brush stimuli and increased after the application of noxious heat. The abilities to detect somatotopic activation within the ganglion and to segregate non-noxious mechanical from noxious thermal stimuli suggest that fMRI will be valuable for measuring changes in the trigeminal ganglion in human models of neuropathic pain and in the clinical condition itself and may also be useful in the evaluation of pain therapies.},

abstract = {Background: Olfactory function is related to the scrutiny of environmental dangers and the tasting of food. However, olfactory dysfunction is not as distinctive as visual loss and may go unnoticed, especially when olfactory function deteriorates slowly. Most studies have used either questionnaires or relatively insensitive tests to assess olfactory dysfunction. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of olfactory dysfunction in Taiwan. Methods: A total of 211 participants were recruited randomly from the community, factories or offices in Taichung City, Taiwan from April 2005 to March 2006. Age ranged from 19 to 89 years (mean age, 43.3 ¬± 12.7 years). All participants filled in questionnaires about sociodemographic data, self-rated olfactory function and impact on quality of life. The olfactory test was performed with identification task of the "Sniffin' Sticks" olfactory function test. Results: The frequency of olfactory dysfunction in our series was 12.3{\%}. There was a statistically significant difference in the ages of the normal and olfactory dysfunction groups (t test, p {\textless} 0.0001). The incidences of parosmia and phantosmia in the 211 participants were 10{\%} and 30.8{\%}, respectively. Most subjects did not rate their olfactory function well. There was no correlation between olfactory function and self-ratings of impact of olfactory function on quality of life. Conclusion: Our present results provide preliminary data and clinical experience regarding the frequency of olfactory dysfunction in Taiwan.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has left many health systems around the world overwhelmed, forcing triaging of scarce medical resources. Identifying indicators of hospital admission for Covid-19 patients early in the disease course could aid the efficient allocation of medical interventions. Self-reported olfactory impairment has recently been recognized as a hallmark of Covid-19 and may be an important predictor of clinical outcome. METHODS A retrospective review of all patients presenting to a San Diego Hospital system with laboratory-confirmed positive Covid-19 infection was conducted with evaluation of olfactory and gustatory function and clinical disease course. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were performed to identify risk factors for hospital admission and anosmia. RESULTS A total of 169 patients tested positive for Covid-19 disease between March 3 and April 8, 2020. Olfactory and gustatory data were obtained for 128/169 (75.7{\%}) subjects of which 26/128 (20.1{\%}) required hospitalization. Admission for Covid-19 was associated with intact sense of smell and taste, increased age, diabetes, as well as subjective and objective parameters associated with respiratory failure. On adjusted analysis, anosmia was strongly and independently associated with outpatient care (aOR 0.09 95{\%} CI: 0.01-0.74) while positive findings of pulmonary infiltrates and/or pleural effusion on chest radiograph (aOR 8.01 95{\%} CI: 1.12-57.49) was strongly and independently associated with admission. CONCLUSIONS Normosmia is an independent predictor of admission in Covid-19 cases. Smell loss in Covid-19 may associate with a milder clinical course. This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and concern for viral transmission by ambulatory patients with minimal to no symptoms underline the importance of identifying early or subclinical symptoms of Covid-19 infection. Two such candidate symptoms include anecdotally reported loss of smell and taste. Understanding the timing and association of smell/taste loss in Covid-19 may help facilitate screening and early isolation of cases. METHODS A single-institution, cross-sectional study evaluating patient-reported symptoms with a focus on smell and taste was conducted using an internet-based platform on adult subjects who underwent testing for Covid-19. Logistic regression was employed to identify symptoms associated with Covid-19 positivity. RESULTS A total of 1480 patients with influenza-like symptoms underwent Covid-19 testing between March 3 through 29, 2020. Our study captured 59 of 102 (58{\%}) Covid-19-positive patients and 203 of 1378 (15{\%}) Covid-19-negative patients. Smell and taste loss were reported in 68{\%} (40/59) and 71{\%} (42/59) of Covid-19-positive subjects, respectively, compared to 16{\%} (33/203) and 17{\%} (35/203) of Covid-19-negative patients (p{\textless}0.001). Smell and taste impairment were independently and strongly associated with Covid-19-positivity (anosmia: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 10.9, 95{\%}CI:5.08-23.5; ageusia: aOR 10.2 95{\%}CI:4.74-22.1); whereas, sore throat was associated with Covid-19-negativity (aOR 0.23, 95{\%}CI:0.11-0.50). Of patients who reported Covid-19-associated loss of smell, 74{\%} (28/38) reported resolution of anosmia with clinical resolution of illness. CONCLUSIONS In ambulatory individuals with influenza-like symptoms, chemosensory dysfunction was strongly associated with Covid-19 infection and should be considered when screening symptoms. Most will recover chemosensory function within weeks paralleling resolution of other disease-related symptoms. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The first step in the olfactory perception is the activation by odorants of sensory neurones in the olfactory epithelium. In humans, this sensory epithelium is located at 2 narrow passages, the olfactory clefts, at the upper part of the nasal cavities. Little is known about the physiology of these clefts. We examined, in 34 patients, the impact of obstructed clefts upon detection and postlearning identification of 5 odorants. The location and extension of the obstructions were assessed using endoscopy, CT scans, and MRI. The inflammatory obstruction was usually bilateral, extending anteroposteriorly, and confined to the clefts, with no sign of obstruction or any inflammatory disease in the rest of the nasal cavities and sinuses. When tested with 5 odorants, these patients showed greatly impaired olfaction compared with a group of 73 normosmic subjects. The majority of these 34 patients had sensory deficits equivalent to that found in another group of 41 congenital anosmic patients, where inspection with MRI indicated the lack of olfactory bulbs. This study demonstrates that the olfactory clefts, in human, function as an entity that is different from other regions of the nasal cavity and is the target for local inflammatory events that are apparently not responding to corticoid and antibiotic treatments. {\textcopyright} 2007 Oxford University Press.},

abstract = {Taste disorders, including taste distortion and taste loss, negatively impact general health and quality of life. To understand the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms, we set out to identify inflammation-related molecules in taste tissue and to assess their role in the development of taste dysfunctions. We found that 10 out of 12 mammalian Toll-like receptors (TLRs), type I and II interferon (IFN) receptors, and their downstream signaling components are present in taste tissue. Some TLRs appear to be selectively or more abundantly expressed in taste buds than in nongustatory lingual epithelium. Immunohistochemistry with antibodies against TLRs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 confirmed the presence of these receptor proteins in taste bud cells, of which TLRs 2, 3, and 4 are expressed in the gustducin-expressing type II taste bud cells. Administration of TLR ligands, lipopolysaccharide, and double-stranded RNA polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, which mimics bacterial or viral infection, activates the IFN signaling pathways, upregulates the expression of IFN-inducible genes, and downregulates the expression of c-fos in taste buds. Finally, systemic administration of IFNs augments apoptosis of taste bud cells in mice. Taken together, these data suggest that TLR and IFN pathways function collaboratively in recognizing pathogens and mediating inflammatory responses in taste tissue. This process, however, may interfere with normal taste transduction and taste bud cell turnover and contributes to the development of taste disorders. {\textcopyright} 2009 New York Academy of Sciences.},

We propose that the multisensory perception of flavor may be indicative of the fact that the taxonomy currently used to define our senses is simply not appropriate. According to the view outlined here, the act of eating allows the different qualities of foodstuffs to be combined into unified percepts; and flavor can be used as a term to describe the combination of tastes, smells, trigeminal, and tactile sensations as well as the visual and auditory cues, that we perceive when tasting food. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Wistar rats were intranasally inoculated with approximately 103 TCID50 of the Coronavirus SDAV. Transverse sections of four regions of the nasal cavity from inoculated and control animals were examined by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 14 days postinoculation (PI). Lesions were observed in the following regions of the upper respiratory tract: respiratory epithelium, transitional epithelium, olfactory epithelium, nasolacrimal duct, vomeronasal organ, and the submucosal glands of the nasal passages. In general, in structures lined by ciliated epithelial cells, there was focal to segmental necrosis with exfoliation of affected cells and polymorphonuclear cell infiltration during the acute stages, progressing to squamous metaplasia during the reparative stages. Repair in these regions was essentially complete by 14 days PI. In the olfactory epithelium and the vomeronasal organ, there was interstitial edema with necrosis and exfoliation of epithelial cells and minimal to moderate inflammatory cell response during the acute stages. Residual reparative lesions were still evident in the olfactory epithelium, the columnar epithelium and neuroepithelium of the vomeronasal organ, and the nasolacrimal duct at 14 days PI. Viral antigen was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in all regions during the acute stages of the disease, with the exception of the vomeronasal organ. In view of these findings, infections of the respiratory tract with viruses such as SDAV could have significant effects on functions such as olfaction and chemoreception for ‚â• 2 weeks postexposure in this species.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Causative viruses of postviral olfactory dysfunction (PVOD) have not yet been identified. The aim of this study was to investigate causative viruses in patients with PVOD. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Nasal discharge was collected from 24 patients with PVOD. We investigated the presence of 10 viruses in nasal discharge and examined the time course, with regard to changes in olfactory dysfunction and nasal obstruction in patients with PVOD, using questionnaires, acoustic rhinometry, and olfactory tests. RESULTS: Rhinoviruses were detected in 10 patients by electrophoresis. Rhinoviruses were also confirmed in four patients by nucleotide sequences. Viral serotypes were identified to be human rhinovirus (HRV)-40, HRV-75, HRV-78, and HRV-80. One of the four patients complained of anosmia, whereas another complained of dysosmia. Olfactory testing did not show significant improvement at 4, 8, 11, and 24 weeks after the first visit in the four patients, although results of acoustic rhinometry significantly improved. Two of the four patients complained of olfactory dysfunction even 6 months after the first visit. Coronavirus and parainfluenza virus were detected in one patient each, and Epstein-Barr viruses were detected in three patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study for the first time detected rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and Epstein-Barr virus in nasal discharge of patients with PVOD. Furthermore, the present study suggests that rhinoviruses can cause olfactory dysfunction through mechanisms other than nasal obstruction and that rhinoviruses can induce various severities and different time courses of olfactory dysfunction.},

abstract = {An important function of the chemical senses is to warn against dangerous biological and chemical agents in the environment. The discovery in recent years of "taste" receptor cells outside the oral cavity that appear to have protective functions has raised new questions about the nature and scope of the chemical senses in general and of chemesthesis in particular. The present paper briefly reviews these findings within the context of what is currently known about the body's chemically sensitive protective mechanisms, including nonsensory processes that help to expel or neutralize threatening agents once they have been encountered. It is proposed that this array of defense mechanisms constitutes a "chemofensor complex" in which chemesthesis is the most ubiquitous, functionally diverse, and interactive chemosensory component.},

abstract = {Spike (S) proteins of coronaviruses, including the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), associate with cellular receptors to mediate infection of their target cells1,2. Here we identify a metallopeptidase, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)3,4, isolated from SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-permissive Vero E6 cells, that efficiently binds the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV S protein. We found that a soluble form of ACE2, but not of the related enzyme ACE1, blocked association of the S1 domain with Vero E6 cells. 293T cells transfected with ACE2, but not those transfected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 receptors, formed multinucleated syncytia with cells expressing S protein. Furthermore, SARS-CoV replicated efficiently on ACE2-transfected but not mock-transfected 293T cells. Finally, anti-ACE2 but not anti-ACE1 antibody blocked viral replication on Vero E6 cells. Together our data indicate that ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV.},

abstract = {A new and highly pathogenic coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)) caused an outbreak in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China starting from December 2019 that quickly spread nationwide and to other countries around the world1‚Äì3. Here, to better understand the initial step of infection at an atomic level, we determined the crystal structure of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 bound to the cell receptor ACE2. The overall ACE2-binding mode of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, which also uses ACE2 as the cell receptor4. Structural analysis identified residues in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD that are essential for ACE2 binding, the majority of which either are highly conserved or share similar side chain properties with those in the SARS-CoV RBD. Such similarity in structure and sequence strongly indicate convergent evolution between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBDs for improved binding to ACE2, although SARS-CoV-2 does not cluster within SARS and SARS-related coronaviruses1‚Äì3,5. The epitopes of two SARS-CoV antibodies that target the RBD are also analysed for binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, providing insights into the future identification of cross-reactive antibodies.},

It involves almost all of the senses, particularly the sense of smell, which is involved through odour images generated in the olfactory pathway. In the human brain, the perceptual systems are closely linked to systems for learning, memory, emotion and language, so distributed neural mechanisms contribute to food preference and food cravings. Greater recognition of the role of the brain's flavour system and its connection with eating behaviour is needed for a deeper understanding of why people eat what they do, and to generate better recommendations about diet and nutrition.},

@article{Shigemura2013,
abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms underlying gustatory detection of dietary sodium is important for the prevention and treatment of hypertension. Here, we show that Angiotensin II (AngII), a major mediator of body fluid and sodium homeostasis, modulates salty and sweet taste sensitivities, and that this modulation critically influences ingestive behaviors in mice. Gustatory nerve recording demonstrated that AngII suppressed amiloride-sensitive taste responses to NaCl. Surprisingly, AngII also enhanced nerve responses to sweeteners, but had no effect on responses to KCl, sour, bitter, or umami tastants. These effects of AngII on nerve responses were blocked by the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonist CV11974. In behavioral tests, CV11974 treatment reduced the stimulated high licking rate to NaCl and sweeteners in water-restricted mice with elevated plasma AngII levels. In taste cells AT1 proteins were coexpressed with $\alpha$ENaC (epithelial sodium channel $\alpha$-subunit, an amiloride-sensitive salt taste receptor) or T1r3 (a sweet taste receptor component). These results suggest that the taste organ is a peripheral target of AngII. The specific reduction of amiloride-sensitive salt taste sensitivity by AngII may contribute to increased sodium intake. Furthermore, AngII may contribute to increased energy intake by enhancing sweet responses. The linkage between salty and sweet preferences via AngII signaling may optimize sodium and calorie intakes.},

abstract = {Recent studies that have compared CT or MRI images of an individual's nasal anatomy and measures of their olfactory sensitivity have found a correlation between specific anatomical areas and performance on olfactory assessments. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques, we have developed a method to quickly ({\textless}few days) convert nasal CT scans from an individual patient into an anatomically accurate 3-D numerical nasal model that can be used to predict airflow and odorant transport, which may ultimately determine olfactory sensitivity. The 3-D model can be also be rapidly modified to depict various anatomical deviations, such as polyps and their removal, that may alter nasal airflow and impair olfactory ability. To evaluate the degree to which variations in critical nasal areas such as the olfactory slit and nasal valve can alter airflow and odorant transport, inspiratory and expiratory airflow with odorants were simulated using numerical finite volume methods. Results suggest that anatomical changes in the olfactory region (upper meatus below the cribriform plate) and the nasal valve region will strongly affect airflow patterns and odorant transport through the olfactory region, with subsequent effects on olfactory function. The ability to model odorant transport through individualized models of the nasal passages holds promise for relating anatomical deviations to generalized or selective disturbances in olfactory perception and may provide important guidance for treatments for nasal-sinus disease, occupational rhinitis and surgical interventions that seek to optimize airflow and improve deficient olfactory function.},

Examples in the mouth include the burn of capsaicinoids in chilies, the cooling of menthol in peppermint, and the tingle of carbonation. It is physiologically distinct from taste and smell, but is increasingly understood to be just as important as these senses for their contribution to flavor, especially with the sustained growth in interest in spicy foods from around the world. Chemesthesis: Chemical Touch in Food and Eating surveys the modern body of work on chemesthesis, with a variety of contributors who are well known for their expertise on the topic. After a forward by John Prescott and an introduction by Barry Green (who originally coined the term chemesthesis 25 years ago), the book moves on to survey chemesthetic spices and address the psychology and physiology of chemesthesis; practical sensory and instrumental analysis; the interaction of chemesthesis with other chemical senses; health ramifications; and the application of chemesthesis in food. The major types of chemesthesis, including pungency/burning, cooling, tingling, nasal irritation, and numbing, are each covered in their own chapter. The book concludes with a look to the future.},

Each sensory system has specialized receptors that respond to a specific stimuli that can be chemical (taste, odor, irritant) or mechanical (texture) in nature. Variability in these sensory inputs can arise from genetics, environmental exposure, diseases, and aging. This variability influences the separate sensory inputs and composite flavor sensations with downstream implications for what we like and chose to eat, such as the quality of the eating experience, and our overall health. In some cases, sensory inputs can be altered or distorted (e.g., phantom sensations). Simple standardized measures are available for screening, such as in-depth assessment of separate sensory systems and integrated flavor sensations.},

The flavor of foods influences the decisions we make about what foods to eat, and in an environment with abundant options, this primarily occurs by causing us to reject certain foods because we do not like the sensations they evoke. In general, bitter sensations tend to be disliked, while sweet sensations are liked; data on other taste qualities are less clear. Notably, there are substantial differences between people, both in their sensory and affective responses, and learning and exposure can decouple sensations from innate aversive responses. Further, dynamic changes in liking within a meal also influence the amount of food we eat.},

abstract = {Sensations experienced in the mouth influence food choices, both immediately and in the long term. Such sensations are themselves influenced by experience with flavors, the chemical environment of the mouth, genetics of receptors for flavors, and individual behavior in the chewing of food. Gustation, the sense of taste, yields information about nutrients, influences palatability, and feeds into the human body's preparation to receive those nutrients. Olfaction, the sense of smell, contributes enormously to defining and identifying food flavors (and is experienced even after placing food inside the mouth). Another vital component of food flavor is texture, which contributes to palatability, especially if a food's texture violates a person's expectations. Next, chemesthesis is the sense of chemically induced irritancy and temperature, for example spiciness and stinging. All of these sensations are potentially modified by saliva, the chemical and physical media of the mouth. As a person experiences the culmination of these oral sensations, modified through an individual's own unique saliva, the flavors in turn influence both what and how a person eats.},

However, humans have also developed a liking for the distinct sharpness or pungency of many foods, beverages, and spices following activation of the same sensory afferents. Our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of chemosensation in the trigeminal system has experienced enormous progress in the past decade, following the cloning and functional characterization of several ion channels activated by physical and chemical stimuli. This brief review attempts to summarize our current knowledge in this field, including a functional description of various sensory channels, especially TRP channels, involved in trigeminal chemosensitivy. Finally, some of these new findings are discussed in the context of the pathophysiology of trigeminal chemosensation, including pain, pruritus, migraine, cough, airway inflammation, and ophthalmic diseases. {\textcopyright}2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The systemic renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is an important regulator of body fluid and sodium homeostasis. Angiotensin II (AngII) is a key active product of the RAS. We previously revealed that circulating AngII suppresses amiloride-sensitive salt taste responses and enhances the responses to sweet compounds via the AngII type 1 receptor (AT1) expressed in taste cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the modulation of taste function by AngII remain uncharacterized. Here we examined the expression of three RAS components, namely renin, angiotensinogen, and angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 (ACE1), in mouse taste tissues. We found that all three RAS components were present in the taste buds of fungiform and circumvallate papillae and co-expressed with {\$}\alpha{\$}ENaC (epithelial sodium channel {\$}\alpha{\$}-subunit, a salt taste receptor) or T1R3 (taste receptor type 1 member 3, a sweet taste receptor component). Water-deprived mice exhibited significantly increased levels of renin expression in taste cells (p {\textless}0.05). These results indicate the existence of a local RAS in the taste organ and suggest that taste function may be regulated by both locally-produced and circulating AngII. Such integrated modulation of peripheral taste sensitivity by AngII may play an important role in sodium/calorie homeostasis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Objective: In this systematic review, we will discuss the evidence on the occurrence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement and neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19. Methods: MEDLINE (accessed from PubMed) and Scopus from December 01, 2019 to March 26, 2020 were systematically searched for related published articles. In both electronic databases, the following search strategy was implemented and these key words (in the title/abstract) were used: ‚ÄúCOVID 19‚Äù OR ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù AND ‚Äúbrain‚Äù OR ‚ÄúCNS‚Äù OR ‚Äúneurologic‚Äù. Results: Through the search strategy, we could identify two articles about neurological involvement by COVID-19. One of these publications was a narrative review and the other one was a viewpoint. However, the authors scanned the reference lists of the included studies and could identify multiple references. One study, specifically investigated the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and could document CNS manifestations in 25{\%} of the patients. Most of the studies investigated the manifestations of COVID-19 in general. Conclusion: While neurological manifestations of COVID-19 have not been studied appropriately, it is highly likely that some of these patients, particularly those who suffer from a severe illness, have CNS involvement and neurological manifestations. Precise and targeted documentation of neurological symptoms, detailed clinical, neurological, and electrophysiological investigations of the patients, attempts to isolate SARS-CoV-2 from cerebrospinal fluid, and autopsies of the COVID-19 victims may clarify the role played by this virus in causing neurological manifestations.},

Here, we examined gene expression in two distinct subpopulations of mouse taste cells: Tas1r3-expressing type II cells and physiologically identified type III cells. Our RNA-Seq libraries met high quality control standards and accurately captured differential expression of marker genes for type II (e.g. the Tas1r genes, Plcb2, Trpm5) and type III (e.g. Pkd2l1, Ncam, Snap25) taste cells. Bioinformatics analysis showed that genes regulating responses to stimuli were up-regulated in type II cells, while pathways related to neuronal function were up-regulated in type III cells. We also identified highly expressed genes and pathways associated with chemotaxis and axon guidance, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying integration of new taste cells into the taste bud. We validated our results by immunohistochemically confirming expression of selected genes encoding synaptic (Cplx2 and Pclo) and semaphorin signalling pathway (Crmp2, PlexinB1, Fes and Sema4a) components. The approach described here could provide a comprehensive map of gene expression for all taste cell subpopulations and will be particularly relevant for cell types in taste buds and other tissues that can be identified only by physiological methods.},

Fine tuning of the gustatory system is also crucial in this respect. The exact mechanisms that fine tune taste sensitivity are as of yet poorly defined, but it is clear that various effects of saliva on taste recognition are also involved. Specifically those metabolic polypeptides present in the saliva that were classically considered to be gut and appetite hormones (i.e., leptin, ghrelin, insulin, neuropeptide Y, peptide YY) were considered to play a pivotal role. Besides these, data clearly indicate the major role of several other salivary proteins, such as salivary carbonic anhydrase (gustin), proline-rich proteins, cystatins, alpha-amylases, histatins, salivary albumin and mucins. Other proteins like glucagon-like peptide-1, salivary immunoglobulin-A, zinc-{\$}\alpha{\$}-2-glycoprotein, salivary lactoperoxidase, salivary prolactin-inducible protein and salivary molecular chaperone HSP70/HSPAs were also expected to play an important role. Furthermore, factors including salivary flow rate, buffer capacity and ionic composition of saliva should also be considered. In this paper, the current state of research related to the above and the overall emerging field of taste-related salivary research alongside basic principles of taste perception is reviewed.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: International experience with COVID-19 suggests it poses a significant risk of infectious transmission to skull base surgeons, due to high nasal viral titers and the unknown potential for aerosol generation during endonasal instrumentation. The purpose of this study was to simulate aerosolization events over a range of endoscopic procedures to gain an evidence-based¬†aerosol¬†risk assessment. METHODS: Aerosolization was simulated in a cadaver using fluorescein solution (0.2mg/10ml) and quantified using a blue-light filter and digital image processing. Outpatient sneezing during endoscopy was simulated using an intranasal atomizer in the presence or absence of intact and modified surgical mask barriers. Surgical aerosolization was simulated during non-powered instrumentation, suction microdebrider, and high-speed drilling following nasal fluorescein application. RESULTS: Among the outpatient conditions, a simulated sneeze event generated maximal aerosol distribution at 30cm extending to 66cm. Both an intact surgical mask and a modified VENT mask (which enables endoscopy) eliminated all detectable aerosol spread. Among the surgical conditions, cold instrumentation and microdebrider use did not generate detectable aerosols. Conversely, use of a high-speed drill produced significant aerosol contamination in all tested conditions. CONCLUSION: We confirm that aerosolization presents a¬†risk to the endonasal¬†skull base surgeon. In the outpatient setting, use of a barrier significantly reduces aerosol spread. Cold surgical instrumentation and microdebrider use pose significantly less¬†aerosolization¬†risk than a high-speed drill. Procedures requiring drill use should carry a special designation as an "Aerosol Generating Surgery" to convey this unique risk, and¬†support¬†the need for protective¬†PPE.

@article{Puputti2019,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}As taste perception varies between individuals, it might be important in explaining food consumption behavior. Previous studies have focused on sensitivity to the bitter tastant PROP (6-n-propylthiouracil) concerning eating with little attention paid to other tastants. For the first time, connections between food consumption behavior, pleasantness, and taste sensitivity are studied with five taste modalities. Sensitivity to bitterness, sourness, umami, saltiness, and sweetness as well as an overall taste sensitivity score was determined with intensity evaluation for 199 Finnish adults. Recalled pleasantness and food consumption behavior were enquired with online questionnaires. Consumption concerned intake of vegetables, fruits, and berries; use-frequency of specific foods; and tendency to mask or modify tastes of foods. All modality-specific taste sensitivities were related to some consumption behavior but none to recalled pleasantness. A higher taste sensitivity score indicated avoidance of coffee, lower consumption of pungent foods, and a more frequent habit of adding ketchup to a meal. In conclusion, it may be more informative to study the influence of taste sensitivity on food consumption behavior with taste modalities separately rather than with a general indicator of taste sensitivity. Additionally, these results highlight the importance of studying actual behavior toward food and not just liking.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Individual taste sensitivity has been claimed to affect food consumption and health. The methods used to assess taste sensitivity are various and thus, cause conflicting results. Thresholds, PROP intensity or fungiform papillae density only partly describe taste function. They may not relate to the actual taste perception in food because of compounds, concentration levels, or the measurement levels used. The objective of the study was to measure individual taste function extensively. With hierarchical clustering, we aimed to reveal taste sensitivity groups among people. Another aim was to investigate the associations between taste qualities. In addition, an overall taste sensitivity score was determined to analyze the generalized taste sensitivity. The sensory study was carried out with Finnish volunteers (N = 205, age 19‚Äì79, 80{\%} females). Citric acid, caffeine, sucrose, NaCl, and MSG were used as the prototypic taste compounds. The subjects rated the intensity of five concentration levels of each tastant. Hierarchical clustering made it possible to analyze the complex data. The results of clustering were distinctive for taste modalities and the number of subjects in the clusters varied. In general, the clusters could be labeled as more sensitive, semi-sensitive, and less sensitive tasters. In bitter and umami tastes one cluster consisted of hyposensitive subjects. The membership in a taste cluster could be partly predicted by the sensitivity to other taste modalities. This study showed that a minority may be hyper- or hyposensitive to all taste modalities. On the other hand, the majority, the semi-sensitive tasters, can be a very heterogeneous group.},

Nevertheless, it is unclear to what extent there is a correlation between ratings of olfactory abilities/impairment and olfactory function.MethodsPatients with olfactory dysfunction (n = 152) were examined psychometrically using the ?Sniffin? Sticks? test battery. Ratings of olfactory function and ratings of impairment were recorded using visual analog scales.ResultsFollowing standardized olfactory testing, 78 of the 152 patients were categorized as functionally anosmic, 64 as hyposmic, and 10 as normosmic. Groups differed significantly with regard to ratings of olfactory function. Functionally anosmic patients rated impairment to be significantly higher compared with hyposmic and normosmic patients. Ratings of olfactory function correlated significantly with measured olfactory function (r = +0.57) and ratings of impairment (r = ?0.30).ConclusionThere was a moderate correlation between ratings and measures of olfactory function. On average, functionally anosmic patients recognized their olfactory loss, although, on an individual basis, there were striking differences between measures and ratings of olfactory function.},
